            <h1>Android Mascot History</h1>

            <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most used for mobile devices in the world. But maybe you don't know that your friendly pet has a name and a very curious history? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p>

            <h2>The first version</h2>

            <p>The first attempt at creating a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="externo">Dan Morrill</a>. He says that he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" class="externo">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of a robot. The objective was just to personify the system just for your team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This first bizarre version was named after its creator: it would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>

            <h2>A new mascot appears</h2>

            <p>The idea of having a mascot was maturing and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/android" target="_blank" class="externo">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

            </picture>

            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The drawing should also generate quick identification with the viewer. Then came the <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new Android mascot.</p>

            <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" class="pequena" alt="Bugdroid">

            <p>The main inspiration for the features of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from those little dolls that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender of each door. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her desk at Google's office and looked towards the bathrooms and the identification was immediate: simple, clean, objective.</p>

                <p>Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a sweet, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 - Cupcake</li>
                    <li>1.6 - Donut</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Eclair</li>
                    <li>2.2 - Froyo</li>
                    <li>2.3 - Gingerbread</li>
                    <li>3.0 - Honeycomb</li>
                    <li>4.0 - Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                    <li>4.1 - Jelly Bean</li>
                    <li>4.4 - KitKat</li>
                    <li>5.0 - Lolipop</li>
                    <li>6.0 - Marshmallow</li>
                    <li>7.0 - Nougat</li>
                    <li>8.0 - Oreo</li>
                    <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> did not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10.                 
                </p>
